How to install the s-net-specific header files
===

Initial download and setup on GNU/Linux:
---
On GNU/Linux systems, installation is easy, as long as the required tools are available.

Preparations:
- Install the "CMake" build system

To compile the HDLC daemon and to install it along with the header files, just follow these steps:
1.) git clone https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-devel.git
2.) cd snet-devel
3.) mkdir build
4.) cd build
5.) cmake ..
6.) make
7.) make install (as root)

The header files will be installed to "/usr/local/include/"



Initial download and setup on Microsoft Windows 7:
---
For Microsoft Windows, one has to install the toolchain first.

Preparations:
- Download the latest "nuwen MinGW" distribution from https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
- Assure that you pick a MinGW distribution that already includes "Git" and the "Boost Libraries"
- Follow the installation guide, e.g., unpack MinGW to C:\MinGW
- Add MinGW to the path according to the installation guide
- Download and install "CMake" from https://cmake.org/download

To compile the HDLC daemon and to install it along with the header files, just follow these steps:
1.) Go to your projects' folder and open a shell there
2.) git clone https://github.com/Strunzdesign/snet-devel.git
3.) cd snet-devel
4.) mkdir build
5.) cd build
6.) Pick yourself a directory to install the compiled files, e.g., consider C:\snet-devel
7.) cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/c/snet-devel ..
8.) If you get an error message on step 7, repeat step 7 once
9.) make
10.) make install

The header files will be installed to "C:\snet-devel\include" if not specified differently.



Update and recompile your local repository (same for all OS):
---
1.) cd snet-devel
2.) git pull
3.) cd build
4.) make
5.) make install

Have fun :-)
